## Project 3
#### Tensoarboard 
- to launch tensorboard run the following command in the root of the project 3: `python -m tensorboard.main --logdir=[PATH_TO_LOGDIR]`
#### FQI
The adaptation of the FQI method using xrt is implemented in the file `FQI.py` and use the `replaybuffer` implement in `utils.py`
#### DDPG
The DDPG method is implemented in the file `DDPG.py` and depends of `Network.py` and `utils.py`
#### DQN
The DDPG method is implemented in the file `DDPG.py` and depends of `utils.py`
#### Softmax 
To launch the softmax algorithm in `interface.py`, just type softmax_simple or softmax_double for respectively the simple and double pendulum
